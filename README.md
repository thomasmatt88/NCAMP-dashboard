**1. Select a material**<br/>
Select an NCAMP qualified material from the top dropdown. Tables will update below with metadata, physical properties, and mechanical properties of chosen material. If only one material is chosen, then a similar material will be recommended. Similarity is determined based off of minimum Euclidean Distance from selected material.
